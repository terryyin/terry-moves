Congratuations! Now you've discovered how Terry moves.

# How to add a new project

## Step 0: Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
git clone	git@github.com:terryyin/terry-moves.git
cd terry-moves
yarn install
```

## Step 1: Add a new story

Under the /src/stories folder, add a new story file. 
The story file is a React component that returns a Story component. like this:

```typescript

export const StoryTransparent: React.FC = () => {
  return (
		<Story id="StoryTransparent" width={720} height={720} subtitles={yourSubtitles}  >
			<AnimationEffect actor="subtitles">
				<Subtitles scale={1}/>
			</AnimationEffect>
      <!-- Add your actors here -->
		</Story>
  );
};
```

Don't forget to add the new story to the `src/Root.ts` file.

Then use command `yarn start` to start the development server. You can see the new story in the browser.

## Step 2: Add subtitles

The `yourSubtitles` in the example above is a list of subtitles. Each subtitle is an object with the following properties:

```typescript
export const yourSubtitles: Subtitle[] = [
	{ leadingBlank: 0, duration: 6, text: 'Product Developers: who are they and why are they on the rise?', translations: {
		zhCN: '何谓产品开发者? 为什么说他们正在崛起？',
		zhTW: '何謂產品開發者？為什麼說他們正在崛起？',
		ja: '製品の開発者（Product Developers）とは。彼らは何者で、なぜ台頭してきているのか。',
	}, actions:[] },
  ...
];
```

## Step 3: Add actors and actions

Please find examples in the `src/stories/` folder.

## Step 4: Build the video

Use command `yarn build`, then choose the store you want to build to build the video. The video will be generated in the `out` folder.

# Translations

To change the language, you need to make the change at the `<Story>` component level. For example:

```typescript
		<Story id="StoryBooleanData" width={720} height={720} subtitles={booleanDataSubtitles} language='zhCN' >
```

# Audio

To add audio, you need to add a `<Audio/>` to the `<Story>` component:

```typescript
		<Story id="StoryBooleanData" width={720} height={720} subtitles={booleanDataSubtitles}>
			<Audio src={staticFile("assets/audios/boolean3ch.mp3")} />
```

# Special actors

## 'camera' actor

The 'camera' actor is a special actor that is used to represent the camera in the scene. It is not a real actor, but a special object that is used to control the camera. You can move it as a normal 3d actor.

The special ability it has is to 'look at' a position.
